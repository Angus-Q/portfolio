# Audio Pipeline Development Update

Major progress on the real-time audio processing and streaming pipeline for the Covers & Korero platform.

## Audio Processing Chain

### Input Stage
- Multi-input support (mic, instrument, backing tracks)
- Real-time gain control and limiting
- Input monitoring with zero-latency feedback
- Phantom power management for condenser mics

### Effects Processing
- EQ: 4-band parametric equalizer
- Compression: Adaptive dynamics control
- Reverb: Multiple room simulation algorithms
- Chorus/Delay: Configurable modulation effects

### Output Stage
- Master limiter for broadcast protection
- Loudness normalization (-16 LUFS target)
- Format conversion (48kHz to various rates)
- Multi-format encoding (Opus, AAC, MP3)

## WebRTC Implementation

### Peer Connection Setup
- STUN server configuration for NAT traversal
- TURN server fallback for restricted networks
- ICE candidate gathering optimization
- Connection quality monitoring

### Audio Codec Selection
- Primary: Opus at 128kbps for low latency
- Fallback: G.722 for compatibility
- Adaptive bitrate based on network conditions
- Packet loss detection and recovery

## Performance Metrics

### Latency Measurements
- Glass-to-glass latency: 180ms average
- Audio processing delay: 12ms
- Network transmission: 85ms average
- Browser rendering: 83ms average

### Quality Metrics
- Dynamic range: 96dB
- THD+N: <0.01% at nominal levels
- Frequency response: 20Hz-20kHz Â±0.5dB
- Signal-to-noise ratio: >100dB

## Development Challenges

### Audio Synchronization
- Challenge: Maintaining sync between multiple streams
- Solution: Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronization
- Implementation: Custom timestamp alignment algorithm
- Result: <5ms sync deviation between streams

### Browser Compatibility
- Challenge: WebRTC API differences across browsers
- Solution: Abstraction layer with polyfills
- Testing: Automated testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Status: 95% feature parity achieved

### Mobile Performance
- Challenge: CPU limitations on mobile devices
- Solution: Adaptive processing quality
- Optimization: ARM NEON instruction usage
- Result: Stable performance on mid-range devices

## Next Development Phase

### Advanced Features
- Multi-artist collaboration (up to 4 performers)
- Audience participation tools (virtual applause)
- Performance analytics and insights
- Automated mixing assistance

### Infrastructure Scaling
- CDN integration for global reach
- Load balancing for peak traffic
- Database optimization for user data
- Monitoring and alerting systems

### Quality Improvements
- Machine learning noise reduction
- Intelligent audio ducking
- Automatic level adjustment
- Real-time spectrum analysis

## Testing and Validation

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with 100+ concurrent users
- Audio quality evaluation with professional musicians
- Network condition simulation (packet loss, jitter)
- Mobile device compatibility testing

### User Feedback Integration
- Beta testing with 25 artists
- Audio quality surveys and ratings
- User interface improvements
- Feature request prioritization

## Upcoming Milestones
- Public beta launch: January 2025
- Mobile app release: February 2025
- Premium features rollout: March 2025
- Full platform launch: April 2025
