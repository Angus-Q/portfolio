# Flight Controller Setup and Initial Testing

Completed setup and initial testing of the Pixhawk 6C flight controller for the autonomous UAV project.

## Hardware Configuration

### Pixhawk 6C Setup
- Firmware: ArduCopter 4.4.4
- Frame type: Quadcopter X configuration
- ESC protocol: DShot600
- GPS module: Here3 RTK connected via CAN

### Sensor Calibration
- Accelerometer calibration completed
- Compass calibration in multiple orientations
- Radio transmitter binding and range testing
- Battery monitor configuration and testing

## Initial Flight Tests

### Manual Flight Mode
- Stabilize mode testing - successful hover
- AltHold mode - stable altitude maintenance
- Loiter mode - GPS position hold working
- Return-to-Launch (RTL) tested successfully

### Performance Metrics
- Hover current: 12.5A average
- Flight time estimate: 28 minutes
- GPS accuracy: Â±1.2m horizontal
- Vibration levels: within acceptable range

## Safety Systems

### Failsafe Configuration
- Radio failsafe: RTL after 3 seconds
- Battery failsafe: Land at 20% capacity
- GPS failsafe: Switch to AltHold mode
- GeoFence: 500m radius, 120m altitude

### Emergency Procedures
- Kill switch configured on transmitter
- Emergency landing site designated
- Flight area cleared and marked
- Observer stationed during tests

## Next Steps

### Companion Computer Integration
- Raspberry Pi 4 mounting and power distribution
- UART connection to Pixhawk for MAVLink
- Camera gimbal installation and testing
- ROS2 node development for autopilot interface

### Advanced Flight Modes
- Auto mode waypoint missions
- Guided mode for programmatic control
- Follow-me mode implementation
- Precision landing capabilities

## Issues Encountered
- Initial compass interference from power distribution board
- Resolution: Moved compass module away from high-current paths
- GPS lock time: 45 seconds average
- Improvement: RTK base station setup planned
