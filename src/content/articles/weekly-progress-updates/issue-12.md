### Research Updates
This week has been very busy with my research. I’m either working at university or asleep. Sadly, I've not had much time or anything else, but I'm keeping up with my domestic jobs quite well. Our conference submission is due mid-September and I’m very sure I will sleep most of the following week.

The featured image in this post shows an experimental setup for testing my designed PCBs on SMA wire, all powered by a battery.

### Song of the Week!

"Drive" by Oh Wonder has had a 10-year re-release. Both artists have amazing voices and musical skills. There are a lot of songs on this rereleased album I am yet to hear as well!
