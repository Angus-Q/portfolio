### Research Updates
This week, my research colleague and I conducted some trials on beef intestines with the purpose of assessing how well capsules of different 'scraping mechanism opening lengths' would collect and retain digesta. The first experiment we ran was unsuccessful. This was due to the lack of peristalsis motions within the intestine, which prevented digesta from entering the capsule. With the addition of peristaltic motions, digesta could be squeezed through the gap allowing for successful collection. We verified this by hand. However, with our repeatable setup, the digesta would build up at the opening of the capsule, which prohibited any collection of digesta. A video of the intestine experiment can be viewed below.

In addition to this, my PCBs arrived this week from JLCPCB in China. This was my first time making and manufacturing a PCB, so I kept the design very simple. It has a microcontroller, MOSFET, and signal processing components. The PCB can be seen in the image below. I aim to have basic communication working with the microcontroller by the end of the week.

### Starting a small business!
Over the last few weeks, I've been putting energy into polishing my website design and development process. Building websites is something I have experience with, including experience with front and backend development. This is something I want to pursue part-time to financially help with my studies and flying. Without a strong client base, I'm looking to build sites at cost for new customers. In time, this would cost me anywhere between $500 and $3,000, depending on the site and scope of the client and their goals for their online site. However, after I do this for about 5 clients, I will start looking at how I can promote and charge out my services, as I'll have a foundational client base I hope can provide good testimonials to my work.

### Song of the Week!

"Not the Same" by Matt Ryder is my song of the week for this week. I really like the drum track, soft vocals, and the horns during the chorus. These elements feel calming and relaxing, although the main kick does add some stronger energy to the song.
