### A Little Curious

Every time I visit up north, I go to Little Curious in Whanganui. They make great bagels, hot drinks, and the shop environment is wonderful. It is an old bookstore-converted-kitchen, and it has a lot of 60s furnishings and flow that still exist. Different seating areas are in different 'former rooms' of what once was originally a house before all else.

If ever in Whanganui, I think anyone should visit this kitchen. It's a wonderful experience, and I think it's also dog-friendly.

### Song of the Week!

By the artist Portugal. The Man, the song 'Waves' is one I hadn't heard on their 'Evil Friends' album before. Back in 2020 when I was traveling over in Los Angeles, I listened to other songs from this artist and from this particular album also, so hearing this song and relistening to others from this album brought back some of these memories despite not being a song I listened to over in the States.
