# Electronics Design Principles

This document outlines fundamental principles for electronics design, covering schematic capture, component selection, and PCB layout best practices.

## Schematic Design

### Component Selection
- Choose components with appropriate voltage and current ratings
- Consider temperature coefficients and tolerances
- Evaluate package types for manufacturing requirements

### Signal Integrity
- Minimize trace lengths for high-frequency signals
- Use proper grounding techniques
- Consider impedance matching for transmission lines

## PCB Layout

### Layer Stack-up
- Define clear power and ground planes
- Maintain consistent trace widths
- Use appropriate via sizes and spacing

### Thermal Management
- Position heat-generating components strategically
- Provide adequate copper area for heat dissipation
- Consider thermal vias for multilayer boards

## Design Verification

### Simulation
- Perform SPICE analysis for critical circuits
- Validate timing requirements
- Check power consumption estimates

### Testing
- Design test points into the layout
- Plan for boundary scan testing
- Include debug interfaces
