# Embedded Systems Architecture

Guidelines for designing robust and maintainable embedded systems, from hardware abstraction to application layers.

## System Architecture

### Layered Design
- Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
- Device drivers and middleware
- Application layer separation
- Real-time operating system considerations

### Memory Management
- Stack and heap allocation strategies
- Flash memory organization
- RAM optimization techniques
- Data structure alignment

## Real-Time Considerations

### Task Scheduling
- Priority-based scheduling
- Interrupt service routine design
- Critical section management
- Deadlock prevention

### Timing Requirements
- Hard vs soft real-time constraints
- Jitter analysis and mitigation
- Worst-case execution time analysis

## Power Management

### Low-Power Design
- Sleep mode utilization
- Clock gating strategies
- Peripheral power control
- Battery life optimization

### Performance vs Power Trade-offs
- Dynamic frequency scaling
- Voltage scaling considerations
- Wake-up time analysis
