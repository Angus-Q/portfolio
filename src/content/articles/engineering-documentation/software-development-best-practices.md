# Software Development Best Practices

Essential practices for writing maintainable, testable, and reliable software for engineering applications.

## Code Quality

### Coding Standards
- Consistent naming conventions
- Function and class design principles
- Comment and documentation standards
- Code review processes

### Static Analysis
- Linting tools and configuration
- Complexity metrics monitoring
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Dependency management

## Version Control

### Git Workflow
- Branch naming conventions
- Commit message standards
- Pull request processes
- Merge vs rebase strategies

### Repository Structure
- Directory organization
- .gitignore best practices
- Submodule management
- Large file handling with Git LFS

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Mock and stub usage
- Code coverage metrics
- Continuous testing practices

### Integration Testing
- API testing methodologies
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing
- System integration validation
- Performance testing

## Continuous Integration

### CI/CD Pipelines
- Automated build processes
- Test automation integration
- Deployment strategies
- Environment management

### Quality Gates
- Code coverage thresholds
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scanning integration
- Documentation generation
