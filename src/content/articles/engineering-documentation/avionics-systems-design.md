# Avionics Systems Design

Design principles and standards for avionics systems, covering safety, certification, and environmental requirements.

## Safety Standards

### DO-178C Compliance
- Software development lifecycle
- Verification and validation processes
- Configuration management requirements
- Quality assurance procedures

### DO-254 Hardware Design
- Hardware design lifecycle
- Requirements capture and traceability
- Verification planning and execution
- Configuration management

## Environmental Considerations

### Operating Conditions
- Temperature range specifications (-55°C to +125°C)
- Vibration and shock requirements
- Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)
- Lightning protection strategies

### Altitude Effects
- Pressure variation considerations
- Cosmic radiation effects
- Single event upset (SEU) mitigation
- Component derating guidelines

## System Architecture

### Redundancy Design
- Dual and triple redundancy systems
- Failure detection and isolation
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Built-in test equipment (BITE)

### Communication Protocols
- ARINC 429 data bus systems
- MIL-STD-1553 protocols
- Ethernet-based avionics networks
- Time synchronization requirements

## Certification Process

### Regulatory Requirements
- FAA certification procedures
- EASA compliance standards
- Military specifications (MIL-SPEC)
- Commercial aviation standards
