### Running Views

A very small update this week from me. I didn't do too much; however, I did do a nice run and saw some great views of the east coast of the South Island. This newsletter is marked as Friday, but I am very late to release it unfortunately, and it wasn’t written on Friday.

I’ll have a more exciting letter next week.

### Song of the Week!

Never Be Like You (feat. Kai) by Flume has a great energy, nice track, and I think Flume has a really solid understanding of music composition while also keeping his style unique and interesting.
