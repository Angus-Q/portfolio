### Welcome!

Today is the launch of my first newsletter. These letters will contain small updates about what I have been doing or what projects I have been working on.

### Flying Progress

As of writing, I am just under 7 hours of flight time gained. I have worked on a variety of different maneuvers from basic control, straight and level, as well as more advanced operations like stalling and slow flight. Each week I continue to train when possible. I aim to be going solo in another 7 hours of flight training.

### Research Progress

My Master's project is going well! I have been developing a robotic gut sampling device using an internal electromagnet to operate a sampling mechanism to allow the capsule to scrape and collect microbiota within the gastrointestinal tract. Next week I will spend more time on developing embedded Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wire capsules to have two actuating technologies to characterise and compare. This is to prepare for the ICRA conference submission in September. If successful, the conference is going to be held in May next year.
