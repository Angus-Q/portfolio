### Website Updates

There are no noticeable website updates at the moment, but I have been working hard in the background to make big changes to my personal website, including adding a better way to write portfolio and newsletter entries. This should make them easier to read and interact with, while loading faster. I aim to have this in production by the time the next newsletter is out.

### Engineering NZ Social Event

This week, Engineering NZ hosted a social event which my mates and I attended. It was nice to meet other engineers in Christchurch and socialize in this setting. I enjoyed it a lot, and I would go to another event. We started at a small bar in town and made our way to a bigger bar for live music in the late evening. Unfortunately, I don't have any photos from this event.

### Photosynthesis Studio Workshop

I attended a studio workshop at Photosynthesis in Christchurch this week. I enjoyed learning about different lighting configurations and scene setups. It was very hands-on and practical, and I got to take some photos away at the end as well. Some of these photos are shown below.

### Flying Progress

This week, I did more basic circuit training. I completed 4 takeoffs and landings. Next week, I hope to try one circuit with a landing without flaps before moving onto advanced and emergency procedures in later circuits.

### Song of the Week!

I heard this song on Double J one evening, and it was really nice, simple, and I thought it had a great melody. Lyrically, I think it is quite simple, which I didn't mind either. I think the guitar and drums combination was all the song needed to be great to listen to late in the evening or in the car.
