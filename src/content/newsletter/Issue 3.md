### Research Updates

This week's research updates include successfully actuating a small resin-printed cantilever. This was done using Nexmetal's 0.1mm 45C SMA wire, with only 1.65v applied before the wire started to burn the printed structure. Additionally, I started setting up a simple load cell on a stepper motor to collect rough results of the output force that each actuator can provide. The load cell moves down along a single axis to push against the open scraping mechanism of the capsule and record force data over time. The stepper motor mechanism was hacked together quickly, so there is a lot of backlash, and some parts will need to be redesigned. What needs to be fixed in particular is improving the concentricity of the lead screw on the stepper motor and adding a bushing to create smooth travel of the load cell as it moves down the guide rod.

### Weekly Highlights

My partner and I went to Soul Quarter restaurant on High Street in Christchurch this week. It was a really nice restaurant with large portion sizes. I would go again. It was nice and quiet, and the service was quick. I didn't get a photo of my meal to put on my newsletter, but I did get a photo of myself—with my sleeves rolled up. I also found a fun pajama shirt from Peter Alexander that says 'Italians do it better'. Lastly, I didn't go flying this week; the weather was not good enough, so I did a takeoff performance chart instead as this was something I needed to practise.

### Song of the Week!

I've only listened to this song once, and it’s called 'Chicago' by 'Sufjan Stevens'. The melody and alternative style are something I really like, and I will look into the artist a bit more. They are not one I have heard of before.
