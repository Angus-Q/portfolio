### Website Updates

This week I did a big website overhaul, which has taken me at least 20 hours. Previously, my site was mostly statically generated with the exception of Bootstrap blog loops for newsletter and portfolio items. My old website was hosted with GitHub Pages, and content was created directly in Bootstrap Studio. Now, I’m using the Astro framework to read, format, and present markdown files dynamically to the reader. This makes content creation as simple as writing my newsletter in a markdown file and dropping it into a folder which contains a collection of articles. Astro will organize my articles by date, and even present the most recent newsletter issue on the front page of my website to new readers. Additionally, I am now using Tailwind CSS over the Bootstrap framework, and I’m now hosting my site with Netlify instead of GitHub Pages. The hosting or development cost for my website hasn’t changed and still remains only the domain registrar fee which I pay yearly.

### Research Updates

After designing and testing 3D resin-printed micro-actuators, I think PDMS-casted actuators will be more appropriate as they are less brittle, therefore less likely to break or deform when acting inside the gut. I’ve spent some time this week working on designing molds to cast PDMS into, and will focus a lot more next week on trialing and testing these actuators with SMA wires embedded within them. Additionally, my colleague and I have started drafting our paper submission for the ICRA conference in 2026.

### Make Lunch not War!

When looking for a photo to include in this week’s newsletter, all I found were photos of the Hobbs meter and tach from my flight, some 3D-printed parts, and screenshots of songs I liked. So, I’ve gone back to when I was in Whanganui over summer, and I took a photo of Homer Simpson graffitied on a wall down the alleyway near the embassy cinema. It says ‘Make lunch, not war’, and I think it’s a good reminder to everyone that when you’re angry or upset, sometimes getting a small bite to eat, or spending time and focus on making, say, a sandwich, can help change your mindset. In the case of making a sandwich, only focusing on the task at hand, getting the bread out of the fridge, spreading on some margarine, and so on. These actions can take your mind away from the stress or worry that you have have. It’s another way of reminding oneself to be present, especially if you are at war with your own mind.

### Flying Progress

On Monday, I did more circuit training. My flying was a lot worse than the previous week, and I’m not sure why. I was confident with my performance charts, NOTAMS, weight and balance, fuel calculations, and other preparation activities. However, when I got into the plane to fly my circuits, I had to go around at least once on final as my line-up wasn’t quite right, or my airplane configuration wasn’t appropriate to land. I’m going to work on this next week, and to help prepare, I’ve been working on remembering my downwind checks (Breaks, Undercarriage, Mixture-Rich, Fuel (Pump, Contents, Cocked, Pressure), Hatches, Harnesses, and Radio Calls) before setting up for landing with card heat, throttle to 1500-1700 RPM, and first stage of flaps (in the white arc). Once at 75Kts, turning onto base. I will also try and take things slower and with more intention, and I think this will help my form, remembering again 75Kts on base and readying 700ft on final approach.

### Song of the Week!

I like the drum beat which comes in during the first chorus of this song. It’s simple, 4 beats per bar, and remains throughout the second verse. It adds a nice energy to the track. Lyrically, I don’t think the song is anything special, but the artist has a really nice voice, and I think the song is nice to have on when working on domestic jobs or doing some study.
