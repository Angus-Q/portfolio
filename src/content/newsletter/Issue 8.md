### A trip to Akaroa

After returning from up north, this week I went to Akaroa to visit as I've never been there before. I found the views great, the food was nice, and myself and a friend did a small hike through the forest they have there. I've linked some photos below of the harbour area, and I especially like the one with the sun coming through the clouds. That photo was taken just as we were about to leave Akaroa.

### Research Updates

I've spent a lot of time and energy on preparing a PCB board for the robotic sampling capsule. The schematic design included various MOSFET switches, two temperature sensors, a high-speed external oscillator, but most of these features I've cut for the first manufactured version. A 10mm diameter PCB is not a lot of space to work on, and after power management, a 4mm x 4mm microcontroller and a MOSFET gate driver for allowing higher current flow through the SMA wire, there isn't much space left on the top side of the board. Next week, I'll work on refining the design, component selection, and board layout to make it more efficient, but I'm glad I've got a board design ready for manufacture as it will be a key talking point in the shared article my colleague and I are writing. The purpose of using a microcontroller to drive the MOSFET switch is to allow the temperature sensors to respond if the temperature of the SMA wires gets too high. We will also test the ability of the system to manage and control the output stroke of the actuator based on the heat through the wires. This would be read through the temp sensor, and controlled by a switching program driven by the microcontroller.

### Flying Updates

I didn't go flying this week, or the last. The only plane trip I've done is the one home from up north. I did enjoy the flight home, and it was nice to see some similar Christchurch views that I would normally get when I'm flying myself.

### Song of the Week!

'Cuban Links' by Benny Page & YoungJakeyy is the song of the week this week. It's a bit different from what I've recommended in previous letters, but this song has a great high-energy, dance feel to it, and I especially like the melody.
