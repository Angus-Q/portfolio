### Another late newsletter!?

Unfortunately, I ran out of time this week to write a bigger newsletter and publish it on time. My colleague and I have started doing a lot of late-night work in preparation for the ICRA conference submission. We are both working hard, trying to get our experiments done. This will continue for more weeks to come, so I'm focused on keeping my head down and getting good results to publish in a journal. 

This was my first week back flying after a month. I enjoyed the flight a lot, but certainly feel out of practice. Sometimes it can be demotivating when you don't see progress in any area, flying, study, or your job. I think it's important then to understand that progress can take time, days, weeks, or months depending on the scope and difficulty. So long as you can make small steps when things are difficult, this will keep your momentum, which can help with more rapid growth in times when one is less demotivated.

Keep flying!

### Song of the Week!

This is a fun, late 70's rock song. I think when the second chorus comes in, there is an increase in energy and perceived pace of the song.
