This is a very small update this week, and again I haven’t taken many photos. Next week I’ll make sure to get a few more good ones to show.

### Pilot’s Logbook

I’ve finally got my official pilot’s logbook, which is really exciting. My logbook is a document of all the flights I’ve taken, including location, time, and a brief description of the flight.

### Research Updates

I’ve spent a lot of time working on PCB design this week. I’ve realized that the knowledge I have around PCB design is a lot less than I need in order to create a small, wireless PCB for the robotic capsule. This week I’ve looked a lot at Altium Designer basics and fundamentals, covering design, PCB routing and manufacturing, signal integrity and more. I’ve taken a very theoretical approach to this, so next week I aim to put this into practice and start developing some small prototype boards. I think this will help me increase my design skills a lot quicker and help me build and retain the knowledge of PCB design and manufacturing, but I’m sure I’ll make a lot of errors along the way. The reason for doing this is to present a complete novel capsule for our ICRA conference paper submission. We think this will yield a better chance of acceptance.

### Song of the Week!

By James Blunt, the song ’The Only One’ was my pick this week. It’s easy to learn and sing, and I find James Blunt always puts so much effort and passion into his music. I’m looking forward to seeing him at his concert later this year!
