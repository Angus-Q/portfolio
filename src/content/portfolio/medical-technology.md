## Overview

Development of innovative robotic capsule technology for sampling microbiota from the gut, enabling early detection of bowel conditions and comprehensive health analysis.

## Study Outcomes

**Project Goal:**  
Develop a robotic capsule to sample microbiota in the small intestine for early detection of bowel conditions and analysis of physical and mental health.

**Capsule Mechanism:**  
Utilize shape memory alloys for micro-actuation of a scraping mechanism to collect and store microbiota samples.

**Technical Development:**  
Design and develop a micro wireless PCB for operating the capsule within the stomach environment.
