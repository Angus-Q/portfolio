### Study Outcomes
- Project Goal:
Develop a robotic capsule to sample microbiota in the small intestine for early detection of bowel conditions and analysis of physical and mental health.
- Capsule Mechanism:
Utilize shape memory alloys for micro-actuation of a scraping mechanism to collect and store microbiota.
- Technical Development:
Design and develop a micro wireless PCB for operating the capsule within the stomach.
