This project involved designing a custom PCB and writing firmware in C++ for a real-time control application. The system was designed for high-reliability aerospace environments, focusing on low-latency communication and fault tolerance.

### Core Technologies
- C++ & FreeRTOS
- KiCad for PCB Design
- CAN bus for communication

The primary challenge was ensuring deterministic response times under heavy load...
