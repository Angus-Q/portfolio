            <span>At the start of 2025, when I finished my Bachelor of Engineering, I was unsure what industry I wanted to join. During my time at university, I hadn't completed many additional projects or done much self-driven learning.</span>
            <span>After a lot of thinking and exploring different areas of engineering, I've found myself finding aerospace and aviation interesting. My goal is to learn and build some aerospace-related projects which I will be documenting on my website with the skillset I have developed within other industries and throughout my time at university. Keep an eye out on this space for any new updates or portfolio entries. Cheers! Angus</span>
